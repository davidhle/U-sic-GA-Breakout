WELCOME TO UGA BREAKOUT!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As they say, "It's up with the white and gold, down with the red and black,
Georgia Tech is out for the Victory, we'll drop the battle axe on Georgia's
head CHOP!" 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this spirit, the goal of this game is to knock out all of the red and black
bricks with your fellow yellow jacket in the game.

Once in the game, the controls are as follows:
A - release ball from paddle
LEFT/RIGHT - move left and right
START - pause & get out of pause

The yellow jacket moves in the same direction as you, so if you're moving to
the left and you hit the yellow jacket, then it will also move that way! The same
goes if you move right or are not moving at all.

The floor is lava and if you let the yellow jacket touch the floor, you lose!
You don't want that to happen because THWg, so break all of the red and black
blocks, and you win!

If you win or lose, then you are able to play the game again by pressing START!

Have fun playing u[sic]ga Breakout!
